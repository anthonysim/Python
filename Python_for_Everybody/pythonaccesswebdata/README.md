# Course # 3 Using Python to Access Web Data - University of Michigan/Coursera

### Chapter 11 Exercise
**Finding Numbers in a Haystack** In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.

### Chapter 12 Exercise
**Exploring the HyperText Transport Protocol** You are to retrieve the following document using the HTTP protocol in a way that you can examine the HTTP Response headers.

**Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup** In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

**Following Links in Python** In this assignment you will write a Python program that expands on http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllinks.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, extract the href= vaues from the anchor tags, scan for a tag that is in a particular position relative to the first name in the list, follow that link and repeat the process a number of times and report the last name you find.

### Chapter 13 Exercise
**Extracting Data from XML** In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geoxml.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the XML data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the XML data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

**Extracting Data from JSON** In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL, read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the numbers in the file and enter the sum below:
We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json (Sum=2553)

Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_79721.json (Sum ends with 67)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

**Calling a JSON API** In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py. The program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.

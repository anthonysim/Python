# exercise 3.1

# asking the user to enter the amount of users and storing it in "hrs."
# changing the hours (in strings) to floats and storing it in "h."
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
h = float(hrs)

# asking the user to input the rate and storing it under "rate."
# changing the rate (in strings) to floats and storing it in "r."
rate = input("Enter Rate:")
r = float(rate)

# conditional, if "h" is 40 hrs or less to print x.
if h <= 40:
    x = (h * r)
    print(x)
elif h >= 40:
    y = (40 * r) + (h - 40) * (r * 1.5)
    print(y)

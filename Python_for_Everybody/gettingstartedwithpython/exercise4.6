# Exercise 4.6

# prompts the user to enter the hours, converts it into floats, then
#places it into a. a equals hours.
#string, integer, float.
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
a = float(hrs)

# prompts the user to enter the rate, converts it into floats, then
#places it into b. b equals rate.
rate = input("Enter Rate:")
b = float(rate)

# function named "computepay" that runs the calculation as stated below.
# return means putting the calulated amount back into computepay(a, b).
# h and r are parameters representing "arguments" within the function.
def computepay(h, r):
    pay = (40 * r) + (h - 40) * (r * 1.5)
    return pay

# conditional if under 40 hrs run code.
if a <= 40:
    x = (a * b)
    print(x)
# conditional if over 40 hrs run the code calling the computepay function
# using a and b (which were from user input above)/the arguments that will
# be used to pass through the paramters in the computepay function.
elif a >= 40:
    x = computepay(a, b)
    print(x)

# University of Michigan/Coursera - Python for Everybody

Each folder should contain a README file with directions as well as a file showing the actual code.

- **Course 1** Getting Started with Python
- **Course 2** Python Data Structures
- **Course 3** Using Python to Access Web Data
- **Course 4** Using Databases with Python
- **Course 5** Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python


**Note:** I'm new to all this. I may have gotten the "right" answer, but I'm sure there must be an easier and more effective way to do so. 

Cheers!
